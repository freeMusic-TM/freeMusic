    <p>This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect the information you provide when using our products and services. We value your privacy and are committed to safeguarding the confidentiality and integrity of your personal data.</p>
    
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>

    <p>Protecting your data is our priority. While we do not collect personal information, we implement administrative, physical, and electronic measures to safeguard any non-personal data from unauthorized access or misuse. However, no security system is completely foolproof, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection against unauthorized access.</p>
