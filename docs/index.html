Privacy Policy
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect the information you provide when using our products and services. We value your privacy and are committed to safeguarding the confidentiality and integrity of your personal data.

Information We Collect
We do not collect personally identifiable information (PII) when you download or use our Android applications. There is no registration required, and we do not track user activity within the app. Additionally, we do not maintain servers to store any PII.

Information Security
Protecting your data is our priority. While we do not collect personal information, we implement administrative, physical, and electronic measures to safeguard any non-personal data from unauthorized access or misuse. However, no security system is completely foolproof, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection against unauthorized access.

Third-Party Links
Our services may include links to third-party websites or services. Any information you provide to these external sites is governed by their respective privacy policies. We do not control or assume responsibility for the content, privacy, or security practices of third-party platforms. We strongly recommend reviewing their privacy policies before sharing any information.

Policy Updates
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and significant updates will be highlighted with a notice. We will not reduce your rights under this policy without your explicit consent.
